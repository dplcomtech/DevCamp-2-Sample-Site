DevCamp 2 Sample Site
=====================
These files are meant to be a starting template for DevCamp 2 participants as they develop their websites. Included here are:
*   A basic HTML5 document
*   A CSS stylesheet
*   A photo
*   One MP3 file

The photo and MP3 file should definitely not be present when the final project is submitted, and the expectation is that the HTML and CSS files will be heavily edited.
